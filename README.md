# Description
The main aim of the project was to introduce Computer Vision.
1. Introduction: an introduction to Computer Vision and some basic Linear Algebra and NumPy required for the later parts of the project.
2. Image processing: This portion started with color spaces and conversions, Image Transformations(rotation, scaling, translation, etc.), then cover filters and kernels (noise removal, blurring, image thresholding) and finally concluded with hough transform, Edge detection(Canny Edge Detection) and contour detection algorithms.
3. ML for Vision: Here, we dealt with some basics of Deep Neural Networks and convolutions, various optimizers, backpropagation algorithm, Gradient Descent, SGD various Loss functions and their usages in Computer Vision context, Regularizations and Bias-Variance trade-off.
4. Applications: In this part, we were introduced to some applications of Computer Vision in the real world and we had to implement one of those in teams of 3. Our team chose to build a document scanner.
